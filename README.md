# What is React Holy Grail?
### Preview: https://react-holy-grail.netlify.app/

The holy grail layout is a layout model commonly used in web design. It features a header area at the top of the page and a footer area at the bottom, spanning the full window width. Between the header and footer are three areas of equal height. The main body of content occupies the center area, with two panels of supporting content or interface elements on either side.

The name "holy grail" refers to a legendary sought-after thing. In the early 2000s, it was difficult to reliably achieve the holy grail layout using existing web technologies. Today the holy grail layout is trivial to implement using widely-adopted technologies, such as CSS Grid or Flexbox.

# Getting Started with React Holy Grail

This holy grail project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
